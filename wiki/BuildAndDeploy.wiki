Howto build and deploy

- Prequisites

Red5 0.9.0 Final (http://code.google.com/p/red5/)
BlazeDS 3.2.0.3948 (http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/blazeds/BlazeDS)

- Building

use java/src as source directory
as libraries you need red5.jar and dependencies from red5 distribution and flex-messaging-*.jar files and dependencies from blazeDS distribution

you probably want to use springs flex integration as well 

- Deploying

see java/sample-web/WEB-INF directory on how to configure/deploy on tomcat. samples use spring-flex.
sample files will setup a simple messaging destination and service to do basic testing.
 


Building and deploying in actionscript

To use the MuleRTMP endpoint in Flex you need to include the swc file provided in as3\MuleRTMPFlexLib\bin or build the MuleRTMPFlexLib project yourself.
The MuleRTMPChannel is still very basic.
